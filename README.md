## üß© Overview  
The goal of this project is to predict a customer‚Äôs **credit score** (Good, Standard, Poor) based on key financial metrics and credit behaviors.  
This helps financial institutions in making better lending and risk-assessment decisions.

## üßπ Data Preprocessing  

- Removed or replaced **special characters**.  
- Converted all applicable columns to **int/float** datatypes.  
- Handled **missing values** using forward and backward filling.  
- Applied **Label Encoding** to categorical columns.  
- Standardized numerical features before model training.

## ü§ñ Model Building  

Three machine-learning models were trained and evaluated:  

- **Logistic Regression (LR)**  
- **Decision Tree (DT)**  
- **Random Forest Classifier (RFC)**  

Hyperparameter tuning was done using **GridSearchCV** for Decision Tree.

## ‚öñÔ∏è Model Comparison  

| Model | Accuracy |
|:--|:--:|
| Logistic Regression | ~61% |
| Decision Tree | ~65% |
| Decision Tree with Hyper Parameter | ~67% |
| Random Forest | ~77% |

## üèÅ Conclusion  

- Random Forest outperformed other models in accuracy.  
- Proper data cleaning and encoding significantly improved model performance.  
- Feature importance analysis shows that **Payment Behaviour**, **Credit Mix**, and **Outstanding Debt** have the strongest impact on credit score prediction.
